<p>My name is Adam Novak, I'm 21 years old and self-employed. I'm mostly involved in camera, editing and general post-production. My dream is to be a full time cinematographer. Cameras and more or less everything around videos and photos have always fascinated me, so I'm trying to develop this passion of mine, and that's why I would also like to be at your wedding and immortalize the feelings and experiences that will be at the wedding. I am of course able to work on other projects that I have experience with as well. In fact, you can take a look at that on the rest of my website.</p>

<h3>My offer:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Full day shoots - be it weddings or anything else</li>
    <li>Complete video editing within a week</li>
   <li>High quality footage from multiple lenses as well as from a drone</li>
    <li>Friendly, classy treatment</li>
</ul>
